var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;

//npm install babel-cli
// npm install babel-preset-env
// npm run build
// These commands will install and run Babel witch will transpile ES6 to ES5 if needed.
