## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.
My computer (the client) asks for the web.html file.  The server responds and starts looking for the file. The client responds and waits. The server sends the file.  The client sends confirmation that the file has been received.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

1) My browser attempts to make contact with the server.
2) The server replies.
3) If that goes well, my browser requests the data.  If not, back to step 1.
4) The server sends the data.
5) If that goes well, my browser decodes the data and displays it to me.  If not, back to step 4.
