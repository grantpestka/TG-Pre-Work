// Because ES6 is predictably backwards compatible, a collection of JavaScript programmers developed a JavaScript library called Babel that transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.

//npm install babel-cli
// npm install babel-preset-env
// npm run build
// These commands will install and run Babel witch will transpile ES6 to ES5 if needed.
